                        <p class="lead">Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses, is the main antagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen. As of late, Sukuna has been defeating the various characters
                            of the series one by one in the manga. The fandom is wondering just how exactly the King of Curses could possibly be defeated, now that
                            most of the cast has been taken out. In fact, many say that Gege Akutami, the author of the series, is making things up has he goes. I made this
                            website to come up with five different ways that the current cast could defeat Sukuna using cunning, wit and determination.</p>

                            <p class="lead">The first plan to defeat Sukuna involves Todo. Todo's cursed technique allows
                                him to switch the place of two objects with cursed energy. This ability is activated with
                                the clap of his hands. Now it's true that his hands got cut off near the end of Season 2,
                                but there's an easy solution to this. With training and lots of squats, Todo won't need his
                                hands to clap at all. </p>
                            <img src="images/Todo.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Todo Main">
                            <p class="lead">Todo's way of defeating Sukuna involves a couple of things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An extremely large object imbued with cursed energy, like a cursed semi-truck</li>
                                <li>An extremely small, thin object imbued with cursed energy, like a crayon</li>
                                <li>An opening to shove the small object inside of Sukuna</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="lead">Todo won't have very many oppurtunities to get a small object inside of Sukuna.
                                Sukuna can grow mouths on his body so shoving it down his mouth won't work. He could conceivably
                                drug Sukuna's food, but we don't yet know if he needs to eat, as we've only ever seen him eat one
                                of his fingers in the series. The only option I see as plausible is if Todo gets it in through
                                another orifice. Then all he has to do is clap and the crayon will switch with the semi-truck and
                                Sukuna will explode. Then they just have to put all his body parts into little containers to
                                prevent him from regenerating.</p>

                                a real chance of beating Sukuna one-on-one. What so many people seem to forget is that he is still
                                alive- and he's cranking 90s and getting epic victory royales in Fortnite.</p>

                            <p class="lead">As we all know and agree, Fortnite is canon and central to every series it has a crossover
                                with. This means that Gojo is still alive and once he's finished training against Omniman and Peter Griffin,
                                it's only a matter of time before he finds his way back to the JJKverse, most likely the same way he left.
                                Once there, he need only team up with literally every other character in the series. He can even bring with
                                characters from Fortnite to help.

                            <p class="lead">Even if Gojo doesn't bring people from Fortnite, there's someone strong enough to
                                come on his own- Son Goku, the Super Saiyan.</p>
                            <img src="images/Goku.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Goku">
                            <p class="lead">Goku is self-explanatory. Even at his most powerful, Sukuna cannot stand against
                                Goku. I don't really interact with the DBZ fandom all that much because all they do is be
                                aggressively straight at you and powerscale Goku against everything. That means Goku has to be
                                at least as strong as like, a million lions. That's a lot of lions. Sukuna has never even met a 
                                lion before. An honorable mention goes out to these characters, who I also feel could easily
                                defeat the King of Curses.</p>

                                blows, heal any injury, but there's one thing he hasn't been confirmed to be resistant to- 
                                overwhelming amounts of drugs and poison.</p>

                                area, one of the largest in the world. This means the chances of one of the characters fighting
                                Sukuna finding some illegal drugs is actually the HIGHEST out of all the places they could fight 
                                him. This means its perfectly plausible for Yuji or Maki to find some crack or something
                                and debuff Sukuna with it. This will even the playing field, and it might even be enough for it
                                to take him out by itself. Do not take drugs unless it is to defeat Sukuna!!!
